## 5.13.2023
Initial release 
Fixed indent guide
## 7.4.2023
Fixed the colors for debugging mode (previously white).
Minor color tweaks done to the sidebar, status bar, activity bar & buttons to help with readability.
## 2.9.2024
changed the primary background color to be slighty raised. I've personally noticed that this theme varies depending on the quality of the display (i.e a gaming monitor will not have the same color accuracy as a Macbook Pro display).
Added a background to the tabs section to match with the rest of the theme.
